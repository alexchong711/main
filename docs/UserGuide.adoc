== Introduction

GradTrak is an application designed for NUS students to easily track their graduation progress. It is currently only limited to courses offered in School of Computing. The primary method of input is Command Line Interface (CLI) which will benefit students of SoC as they generally type quickly. Proceed to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `GradTrak.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Module Plan.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`update`* : retrieves the latest information of all modules from CORS.
* **`add`**`c/cs1010 s/y1s1 g/A` : adds the module "CS1010", taken in Y1S1 with grade A, into the list of completed modules.
* **`delete`**`1` : deletes the first module on the most recently displayed list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add c/MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/cs1010`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `c/MODULE_CODE [g/GRADE_OBTAINED]` can be used as `c/cs1010 g/A` or as `c/cs1010`.

* IS` - Information System
* `IFS` - Infocomm Security
****

Examples:

* `set IFS` +

****
* Possible grade options are the standard letter grades (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B- etc.) and IC, EXE, CS, CU, W, S, U.
* You cannot add an existing module with the same semester.
* You can only add a module if you have previously added its prerequisites.
****

Examples:

* `add c/cs2103t s/y2s2` +
Adds CS2103T, to be taken in Y2S2, to the module plan.

* `add c/cs2103t s/y2s2 g/B-` +
Adds CS2103T, taken in Y2S2 with grade B-, to the module plan.

=== Edit module: `edit`

Edits the semester or grade of a module in the module plan based on module code or index in the most recently displayed list. +

        or +
        `edit INDEX [s/NEW_SEMESTER] [g/NEW_GRADE_OBTAINED]` +

****

Examples:

* `delete c/cs2103t` +

* `delete 1` +
Deletes the first module on the most recently displayed list.

=== Find module: `find`

Finds a module in the module plan based on module code, module title, semester taken or grade obtained. +
Format: `find [c/MODULE_CODE] [t/MODULE_TITLE] [s/SEMESTER] [g/GRADE_OBTAINED]`

****
* Parameters can be in any order.
* Modules matching ALL of the above parameters will be listed.
