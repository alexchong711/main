== Introduction

GradTrak is an application designed for students of National University of Singapore (NUS) to easily track their graduation progress.
The current version of the application offers graduation requirement tracking to Computer Science majors (namely the Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering Focus Areas).
Stay tuned as we will be adding other courses in the near future!

Users can interact with the application by entering commands into the command box. This will benefit Computer Science majors as they can generally type quickly.

== Installation Guide

Follow the instructions below to install this application.

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your computer.
.  Download the latest `GradTrak.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your GradTrak.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The app window should appear within a few seconds.

== Quick Guide

Read the guide below to have a quick understanding of the usage of this app.

.Parts of the User Interface
image::annotated-ui.png[width="790"]

. Refer to `Fig 1` for parts of the User Interface (UI). Here are the brief functionalities
of the UI annotated above:

.. Task Bar: You can exit the application or access the help menu (this guide) here.

.. Command Box: You can enter a command here to access the features of the application

.. Result Box: You receive feedback for your entered command here. If the command is unsuccessfully executed,
the correct input format of the command will be provided.

.. Result Panel: You can view the information associated with the command entered here.

.. Module Panel: You can view the details of the modules that you have taken
or are planning to take.

.  To access a feature of the application, type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it.
For example, typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. You might wish to set the course of study first. There are currently 3 courses available in this app: Computer Science Algorithms,
Computer Science Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science Software Engineering.
To set the course, enter one of the following commands:
`study Computer Science Algorithms`, `study Computer Science Software Engineering` or `study Computer Science Artificial Intelligence`.
.  Here are some commands you can try:
* **`add`**`c/CS1010 s/Y1S1` : adds the module "CS1010", taken in Y1S1, into the module plan.
* **`delete`**`1` : deletes the first module on the most recently displayed list.
* **`displayreq`**: displays information on your course requirements and the percentage completed for each requirement.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

Here we only introduced some of the more basic functions and commands of GradTrak. The following section, <<Features>>,
will give you a more detailed guide/walk through for each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user, e.g. in `add c/MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/cs1010`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `c/MODULE_CODE [g/GRADE_OBTAINED]` can be used as `c/CS1010 g/A` or as `c/CS1010`.
====

=== Add module: `add`

Adds a module to GradTrak based on the given module code, semester taken and expected / obtained grade. +
Format: `add c/MODULE_CODE s/SEMESTER [min/NEW_EXPECTED_MIN_GRADE] [max/NEW_EXPECTED_MAX_GRADE] [lec/NEW_LECTURE_HOURS] [tut/NEW_TUTORIAL_HOURS] [lab/NEW_LAB_HOURS] [proj/NEW_PROJ_HOURS] [prep/NEW_PREP_HOURS]` +

`add c/MODULE_CODE s/SEMESTER [g/NEW_EXPECTED_MIN_GRADE NEW_EXPECTED_MAX_GRADE] [lec/NEW_LECTURE_HOURS] [tut/NEW_TUTORIAL_HOURS] [lab/NEW_LAB_HOURS] [proj/NEW_PROJ_HOURS] [prep/NEW_PREP_HOURS]`

****
* Possible grade options are the standard letter grades (A_PLUS, A, A_MINUS, B_PLUS, B, B_MINUS etc.) and IC, EXE, CS, CU, W, S, U.
* You cannot add an existing module with the same semester.
* You can only add a module if you have previously added its prerequisites.
****

Examples:

* `add c/CS2103T s/Y2S2` +
Adds CS2103T, to be taken in Y2S2, to the module plan.

* `add c/CS2103T s/Y2S2 max/B_MINUS` +
Adds CS2103T, to be taken in Y2S2 with expected max grade B-, to the module plan.

=== Listing all modules in module plan: `cklimit`

Calculates the expected total workload and expected min and max CAP of each semester and checks against the limit set by the user. +
Format: `cklimit`

=== Clear all data entered: `clear`

Deletes all the added modules. +
Format: `clear`

=== Sets the current semester: `cursem`

Indicates that the previous semesters must have a single finalized grade in the expected grade range. +
Format: `cursem`

=== Delete module: `delete`

Removes a module from GradTrak based on module code or index in the most recently displayed list. +
Format: `delete INDEX` +
or +
`delete c/MODULE_CODE`

****
* Shows a message if the given module code is not found.
****

Examples:

* `delete c/CS2103T` +
Deletes CS2103T from GradTrak.
* `delete 1` +
Deletes the first module on the most recently displayed list.

=== Display module information: `displaymod`

2 options to display module information either by the module code or module title.
It is possible to search for multiple modules at the same time by typing the next module code preceded by a comma. +
Format: `displaymod c/[Module Code],[Module Code]`

It is also possible to search for modules by typing out a word found in the module title. For a more streamlined
search, type in the specific keywords found in the title combined with a "+" symbol. +
Format: `displaymod n/[keyword]+[keyword]`

User can also use both type of searches concurrently for ease of search.

1 mode for o/OPTIONS include:

.  `n/KEYWORDS n/[NUMBER]` *Coming in V2.0*
* Displays top n (3 if last argument is left blank, capped at 10) information most related modules based on keywords inserted.

Examples:

* `displaymod c/CS2103T` +
Displays all information with regards to Module: CS2103T i.e Module name, Module description etc. .

* `displaymod c/CS2103T,CS2101,CS1010,ACC1002X` +
Displays all of the 4 module information in-order with the search.

* `displaymod c/CS2103T,CS2101 n/computer+science` +
Displays the modules CS2103T,CS2101 and all modules with the words 'computer' and 'science' in its title.

// tag::Displayreq[]
=== Display Course Requirements: `displayreq`
One of the core functions of GradTrak is to track whether the user has fulfilled his/her degree requirement.
As of `v1.3` of the application, GradTrak currently only has course information of 3 Computer Science major Focus Areas, namely:

* Algorithms
* Artificial Intelligence
* Software Engineering

You may refer to the guide on `study` command to understand how to set your current course of study.

Using the information of the modules the user has already taken or is planning to take in the future semesters,
this command informs the user whether they have completed a certain Graduation / Course Requirement. If a certain requirement is not completed, this command will also inform the user an approximate degree of completion of the requirement and also
at the same time, suggest some other modules offered by NUS which they can take to fulfill the requirement.

Format: `displayreq`

// end::Displayreq[]

=== Edit module: `edit`

Edits the semester or grade of a module in the module plan based on module code or index in the most recently displayed list. +
